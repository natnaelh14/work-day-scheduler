In this project, I made a web application that allows users to make schedule for a work day. I initially used bootstrap jumbotron and bootstrap box to build out the html. I used css to add some styling.  I created css class names (past, present & future) and based on the current time, I assigned the right color for each bootstrap box.  I then created local storage to 
store user notes. Thanks!
