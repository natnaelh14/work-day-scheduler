Project Name: Work Day Scheduler
Project Link: https://natnaelh14.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

In this project, I made a web application that allows users to make schedule a work day. I initially used bootstrap jumbotron and bootstrap box to build out the html. I used css some css styling.  I created css class names (past, present & future) and based on the current time, I assigned the right color for each bootstrap box.  I then created local storage to store user notes. Thanks!
